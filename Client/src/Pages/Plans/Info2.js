              <p className="mb-5 leading-relaxed">
                Caresure Health Insurance plans provide more flexible benefits
                when the policyholder buys a mediclaim policy and goes through
                certain hardships. For instance, when the sum insured gets
                exhausted, additional coverage is provided without any extra
                premium. This is where benefits like Automatic Restoration of
                the basic Sum Insured, Super Restoration of the basic Sum
                Insured and Road Traffic Accident (RTA) on the sum insured come
                into place.
                <br />
                Note: These flexible benefits are product/policy specific.
                Please refer to the policy clause to learn more.
